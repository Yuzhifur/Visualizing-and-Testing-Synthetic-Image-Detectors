# Visualizing-and-Testing-Synthetic-Image-Detectors
We focus on visualizing detectors with different architectures and sources of input synthetic images. Additionally, we want to test these detectorsâ€™ robustness on degraded inputs, which reveals if they attend to certain textures and if they have limited robustness.
